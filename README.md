### iOS N-Body Metaball Simulation

iOS n-body simulation combined visualized with metaballs. Physics and graphics provided by *cocos2d* using *Objective-C*.

You can compare an analogous *SpriteKit*, *Swift* version [here](https://github.com/fisch0920/Gravity-spritekit).

## Ideas / Inspiration:
    * Rorschach Test
    * FarCry 3 intro screen
    * virus exploding cell
    * functionality:
        * kill circles
        * be able to coerce nodes into a certain shape
        * probably easiest to just use polygon drawn

* need to improve efficiency of multiple bodies
    * main bottleneck is simulation
